For the python version you will need the following libraries:
sys
pyautogui
mss
colorama

*SYS is probably already on your computer but try installing it just to be sure

ALL Libraries can be installed with pip or pip3

You shouldn't need anything for the exe version
If you have multiple monitors it could be offset on your secondary one
Feel free to comment your suggestions for new projects or edits to this one or others in the future
